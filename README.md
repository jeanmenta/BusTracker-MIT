# Real-time Bus Tracker

This project showcases an interactive real-time bus tracking application that displays bus locations for a selected route using the Mapbox API and MBTA API. Users can select a route, and the application will display the buses on a map with markers, updating their positions every 15 seconds.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Replace `'YOUR_MAPBOX_API_KEY'` in the `mapanimation.js` file with your actual Mapbox API key.
3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
4. Select a route from the dropdown list and observe the real-time bus locations on the map. Click on a bus marker to see more information about the bus.

## Roadmap of future improvements
- Enhance the bus marker design with custom icons representing different bus types.
- Add options for users to filter buses by attributes, such as direction or status.
- Implement a feature to show the estimated time of arrival (ETA) for the next bus stop.
- Add geolocation support to center the map on the user's current location.
